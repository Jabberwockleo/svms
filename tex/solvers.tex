\title{Solvers}

SVM solvers is typically classified into two groups
\startitemize[-]
\item \bold{Working on the primal problem} $L_2\text{-SVM-MFN}$, Pegasos
\item \bold{Working on the dual problem} SMO, cutting-plane 
\stopitemize

By approaches they can be classified into
\startitemize 
\item \bold{Interior Point methods (Barrier Method)} $L_2\text{-SVM-MFN}$
\item \bold{Decomposition methods} SMO, cutting-plane
\item \bold{Gradient based methods} Pegasos
\stopitemize

SMO is a milestone that make large scale learning possible. Cutting-plane algorithms are simple, elegant fast improvement of decomposition methods, and is effective on structured learning. $L_2\text{-SVM-MFN}$ is another famous fast solver. While gradient based methods are known to exhibit slow convergence rates, Pegasos is fast by proving that optimal $||\omega||_2 \leq 1/\sqrt{\lambda}$.
